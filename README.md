# 3D Object Detection On NuScenes
This was the second project done for the 3D Perception, Learning-Based Data Fusion Course held at the University of Parma.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an object detection system tailored for autonomous
vehicles navigating urban environments by integrating LiDAR and camera inputs.
